  ## Introduction

   This project was a solo project that I completed in while learning React! This project was a great learning experience as i got to implement complex logic to create a fully functional application.

  ## Technologies

  - Javascript
  - React
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Router V6
  - XML
  - Context


  ## Features

  This application fetches movie data from an api and displays the data in organized rows.  This application allows users to search, add, and remove movies they're interested in to a watch list that saves those choices in local storage.

  ## Possible Future Extensions

  Some future extensions that i would like to add is an option to select genres from a drop down menu and add a details page that shows that movies trailer.

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. Have Fun!
